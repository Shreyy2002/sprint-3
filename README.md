# Declarative Jenkins Pipeline | Notification

---

## Intro 
A Declarative Pipeline in Jenkins is a way of defining and managing Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows using a simplified, structured syntax
Declarative Pipelines are designed to be more readable and maintainable, promoting consistent and concise pipeline definition.

---

## Prerequisite
- Install slack and email template plugin.
- Setup slack and email global configurations.

---

## Declarative Pipeline for Notification

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        NOTIFY_EMAIL = 'shreytyagi75@gmail.com'
        SLACK_CHANNEL = '#slack-notification' 
    }

    options {
   
        timestamps()
    }

    stages {
        stage('Test Success Notification') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running a SUCCESS simulation...'
                sh 'exit 0'
            }
        }

        stage('Test Failure Notification') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running a FAILURE simulation (intentionally fails)...'
                // This command will fail and trigger the 'failure' block
                sh 'exit 1'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo '‚úÖ Build Succeeded!'
            slackSend (
                channel: "${env.SLACK_CHANNEL}",
                color: '#00FF00',
                message: "‚úÖ SUCCESS: *${env.JOB_NAME}* #${env.BUILD_NUMBER} (<${env.BUILD_URL}|Open>)"
            )
            mail to: "${env.NOTIFY_EMAIL}",
                 subject: "‚úÖ Jenkins Job Success: ${env.JOB_NAME} #${env.BUILD_NUMBER}",
                 body: """\
The Jenkins job *${env.JOB_NAME}* completed successfully.

Details:
${env.BUILD_URL}
"""
        }

        failure {
            echo '‚ùå Build Failed!'
            slackSend (
                channel: "${env.SLACK_CHANNEL}",
                color: '#FF0000',
                message: "‚ùå FAILURE: *${env.JOB_NAME}* #${env.BUILD_NUMBER} (<${env.BUILD_URL}|Open>)"
            )
            mail to: "${env.NOTIFY_EMAIL}",
                 subject: "‚ùå Jenkins Job Failed: ${env.JOB_NAME} #${env.BUILD_NUMBER}",
                 body: """\
The Jenkins job *${env.JOB_NAME}* has failed.

Logs:
${env.BUILD_URL}console
"""
        }

        always {
            echo "üì£ Notification testing complete. Build result: ${currentBuild.currentResult}"
        }
    }
}
```

- Above is the pipeline code for the declarative pipeline, which sends the notification to slack and email about the build whether it fails or success.
- Below are the screenshots of notification recieved on email and slack.

# Scripted Jenkins Pipeline | Notification

## Intro
In summary, Jenkins Scripted Pipeline offers a versatile and expressive way to define CI/CD workflows using Groovy scripting. It empowers teams to handle complex pipeline scenarios, though striking a balance between customization and maintainability is crucial.
The core difference between Scripted and Declrarative pipeline is that though scripted pipeline is a bit more complex than declarative, but at the same time scripted is more customizable than declarative. Rest both are used for defining CI/CD pipeline, it depend on your usecase which format to use.

## Prerequisite
- Install slack and email template plugin.
- Setup slack and email global configurations.

## Scripted Pipeline for Notification

```groovy
node {
    // Define global environment variables

    timestamps {
        try {
            stage('Test Success Notification') {
                echo 'Running a SUCCESS simulation...'
                sh 'exit 0'  // Simulate success
            }

                sh 'exit 1'  // Simulate failure
            }

            // Send success notifications (only if both stages succeed)
            echo '‚úÖ Build Succeeded!'
